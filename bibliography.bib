@article{Nakajima:2014,
	Abstract = { Multivariate stochastic volatility models with skew distributions are proposed. Exploiting Cholesky stochastic volatility modeling, univariate stochastic volatility processes with leverage effect and generalized hyperbolic skew t-distributions are embedded to multivariate analysis with time-varying correlations. Bayesian modeling allows this approach to provide parsimonious skew structure and to easily scale up for high-dimensional problem. Analyses of daily stock returns are illustrated. Empirical results show that the time-varying correlations and the sparse skew structure contribute to improved prediction performance and Value-at-Risk forecasts. },

	Abstract = { The generalized extreme value model was developed by D. McFadden for the case with discrete choice sets. The present paper extends this model to cases with both discrete and continuous choice sets and choice sets that are unobservable by the analyst. The author also proposes behavioral assumptions that justify random utility functions (processes) that have a max-stable structure, i.e., utility processes where the finite dimensional distributions are of the multivariate extreme value type. Finally, he derives nonparametrically testable implications for the choice probabilities in the continuous case. Copyright 1994 by The Econometric Society.},
