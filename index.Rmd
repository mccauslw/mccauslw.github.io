I am an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Montreal.

My current research interests fall in two main areas:  

1. Random discrete choice analysis  
    + collection and analysis of data from discrete choice experiments  
    + Bayesian analysis of abstract discrete choice models  
    + testing random utility and other probabilistic discrete choice axioms  
    + choice anomalies such as context effects and stochastic intransitivity  
1. Non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models  
    + stochastic volatility, count and duration models
    + multivariate models

The courses I am teaching now or have taught recently are:  

1. Probability for Economists (University of Montreal, Ph.D.)  
1. Elements of Microeconomics (University of Montreal, M.Sc.)  
1. Econometrics of Financial Markets (University of Montreal, M.Sc.)
